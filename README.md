# TDSP-Project
# NYC Traffic Safety Optimization Using Geospatial Machine Learning

This project analyzes over 2.15 million motor vehicle collision records from NYC to identify high-risk zones and predict injury severity trends. Using geospatial and time series analytics alongside machine learning, the goal is to support data-informed transportation policy and safety interventions.
